# WordPress Theme Technical Test

This technical test evaluates the ability to develop a WordPress theme from scratch and integrate it with a predefined HTML layout. The theme requirements include:

- A homepage featuring a video and customizable text managed through the WordPress admin panel.
- A grid layout displaying elements (e.g., books) with links to individual detail pages.
- Implementation of books as a Custom Post Type (CPT) with specific fields:
  1. Title (using the WP title field).
  2. Authors.
  3. Cover.
  4. Publication Year.
  5. Genre (a custom taxonomy for the book CPT).

The use of Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is necessary for generating these custom fields. The test focuses on understanding the WordPress structure and working efficiently and cleanly with it. No menu or multi-language support is required.
